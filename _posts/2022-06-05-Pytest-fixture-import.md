I’m a big fan of classes and sometimes I do OOP, event if it is not necessary. But hey, everyone has its own style!

## The problem

I don’t know why, but I had this opinion that when testing views I should go with class approach. The problem appears when I wanted to load fixture in single test. YOU CAN’T! And there is even a note in docs. 

> ``unittest.TestCase`` methods cannot directly receive fixture arguments as implementing that is likely to inflict on the ability to run general unittest.TestCase test suites. The above ``usefixtures`` and ``autouse`` examples should help to mix in pytest fixtures into unittest suites. You can also gradually move away from subclassing from ``unittest.TestCase`` to *plain asserts* and then start to benefit from the full pytest feature set step by step.


And quick note. Do not hate me because of test naming. It is just to show you sth.  

## Solution 1

Ok. So let’s start with usefixtures. Basically you can import fixture by its name with string value and it works.

```python
# /test_views.py

class ExerciseViewTestCase(TestCase):
	@pytest.mark.django_db
	@pytest.mark.usefixtures('exercise')
	def test_endpoint_should_return_list_of_exercises(self):
	    response = self.client.get(reverse('classes:exercise-list'), **self.get_header())
	    assert response.status_code == status.HTTP_200_OK
			assert response.data != []
```

Also if you want to use this exercise feature across multiple tests in this class you can go with: 

```python
# /test_views.py

@pytest.mark.usefixtures('exercise_instance')
class ExerciseViewTestCase(TestCase):
    @pytest.mark.django_db
    def test_endpoint_should_return_list_of_exercises(self):
        response = self.client.get(reverse('classes:exercise-list'), **self.get_header())
        assert response.status_code == status.HTTP_200_OK
				assert response.data != []
```

I had this exercise in response. But hey! I wanted to know if it is exactly this exercise I’m importing with fixtures, so I needed its instance in argument! 

The problem is as they said.. “…cannot directly receive fixture arguments…”.  🙁 

The walk-around which is for me MUCH BETTER/CLEANER/**SEXIER** solution now, is to get rid of TestCase class. 

## Solution 2

So what do we need: 

- Client
- Logged user
- Exercise fixture

Superuser and its Client can be a fixture too. 

```python
# /conftest.py

@pytest.fixture()
def superuser():
    return UserModel.objects.create_superuser(
        username='test_user',
        email=EMAIL,
        password=TEST_PASSWORD
    )

@pytest.fixture()
def superuser_client(superuser):
    client = Client()
    
    token = client.post('/rest-auth/login/', data={
        'username':EMAIL,
        'password':TEST_PASSWORD
    }).data.get('key')
    
    client.defaults.update({'HTTP_AUTHORIZATION': f'Token {token}'})
    return client
```

I had the token authentication so after logging I needed to update defaults argument in Client instance. 

After this I can import as argument a superuser_client. It will be logged (with token set) and ready to make requests. 

Let’s go back to this sexy test. 

```python
# /test_views.py 

@pytest.mark.django_db
def test_endpoint_should_return_list_of_exercises(client_with_superuser, exercise_instance):
    response = client_with_superuser.get(reverse('classes:exercise-list'))
    assert response.status_code == status.HTTP_200_OK
    assert response.data[0].get('id') == exercise_instance.id
```

Smooth.. 

Cheers!
