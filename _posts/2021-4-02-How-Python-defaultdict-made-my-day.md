Mission for today: Kill nasty if statements that you don't want to care about!

### Everything starts with the problem 

And I have already solved this problem! I had to map some git repo folder structure based on GitHub API response, to python dict with structure like: 

```json
{
    "folder_1_lvl_1" : {
        "folder_1_lvl_2" : {
            "file_1" : "some_file_name_1",
            "file_2" : "some_file_name_2",
            "file_3" : "some_file_name_3"
        },
        "folder_2_lvl_2" : {
            "file_1" : "some_file_name_1",
            "file_2" : "some_file_name_2",
            "file_3" : "some_file_name_3"
        }
    },
    "folder_2_lvl_1" : {
        "folder_1_lvl_2" : {
            "file_1" : "some_file_name_1",
            "file_2" : "some_file_name_2",
            "file_3" : "some_file_name_3"
        },
        "folder_2_lvl_2" : {
            "file_1" : "some_file_name_1",
            "file_2" : "some_file_name_2",
            "file_3" : "some_file_name_3"
        }
    }
}
```
Seems quite simple, but what was my API response code (JSON below)? It's only some part of structure above. I hope you will get the point. The main difference is type on dict in ‚Äútree‚Äù list. You can see that *three* is representing some folder and *blob* is some file. First thing is to filter this list, next is to know folder structure for every file (blob here), and we will use a ‚Äúpath‚Äù for that ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è. Let's do it simple. `` path_list = file['path'].split('/') ``.  

```json
{
    "sha": "some_sha",
    "url": "some_url",
    "tree": [
        {
            "path": "folder_1_lvl_1",
            "mode": "040000",
            "type": "tree",
            "sha": "another sha",
            "url": "another url"
        },
        {
            "path": "folder_1_lvl_1/folder_1_lvl_2",
            "mode": "040000",
            "type": "tree",
            "sha": "sha",
            "url": "url"
        },
        {
            "path": "folder_1_lvl_1/folder_1_lvl_2/file_1",
            "mode": "040000",
            "type": "blob",
            "sha": "sha",
            "url": "url"
        },
    ]
}

```

### A bit of extra background 

One thing extra before we get to the point. I assumed that folder structure in repo will correspond to structure of studies like: 

```txt
    semester_1 
        | - course_1
                | - lab_1
                      | - excercise_1    <- it is file already
                      | - excercise_2    
                      | - excercise_3    
                | - lab_2
                | - lab_3
        | - course_2
        | - course_3

```
So imagine the list of dictionaries with fields like *semester*, *course*, *lab*, *exercise*. Let's make it one dict for backend response üòé

### Old way that worked

Yes, it worked, and I had no complaints about it until I got to know another approach!   

```python 
def group_courses(files):
    result = {}
    
    for file in files:
        if file["course"] not in result.keys():
            result[file["course"]] = {}

        if file["lab"] not in result[file["course"]].keys():
            result[file["course"]][file["lab"]] = {}

        if file["excercise"] not in result[file["course"]][file["lab"]].keys():
            result[file["course"]][file["lab"]][file["excercise"]] = {
                "file" : file["excercise"],
                "semester": file["semester"],
                "lab" : file["lab"],
                "course" : file["course"],
            }
    return result

```

### DEFAULTDICT from Collections

Imagine you don't have to check whether there is such key as *course* or *lab*. It would be nice üöÄ! Below example won't raise exception. It will automatically create simple dictionary on level below *defaultdict*. 

```python 
from collections import defaultdict 

file_dict = defaultdict(dict)

# won't raise KeyError
file_dict['some_folder_lvl_1']['some_folder_lvl_2']  = {
    "file": "file_name"
}

```

But what if we want to go deeper. Imagine ``file_dict['some_folder_lvl_1']['some_folder_lvl_2']['some_folder_lvl_3]``, it raises ``KeyError`` because *defaultdict* is only on top level of our dictionary. Defaultdict with no argument acts like dict. We could do `` my_dict = defaultdict(defaultdict(defaultdict( üëæ ))) `` but lol, nope. 

Here comes **recursive defaultdict** üòé. Sounds cool enough for me!  

Let's just tell python to create another level of defaultdict, every time *KeyError* in basic dict would happen. 

```python 
from collections import defaultdict 

def nested_dict():
    return defaultdict(nested_dict)

# and above function wolud look like this now!
def group_courses(files):
    result = nested_dict()
    
    for file in files:
        result[file["course"]][file["lab"]][file["excercise"]] = {
            "file" : file["excercise"],
            "semester": file["semester"],
            "lab" : file["lab"],
            "course" : file["course"],
        }
    return result
```

And you know what? Result is the same but how much fewer places to make mistake! How much less if statements that I understood only at the time of writing! I like it a lot! 

If you want some fancy details about defaultdict, check out [docs](https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.defaultdict). Basically the idea here is to handle ``KeyError`` and supply dict with some default variable. And here it is even recursive!
