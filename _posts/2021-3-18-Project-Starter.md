Let's start this blog very simple. I made my first shell script! As we all programmers want to automate, I have automated.. starting a project.. ðŸ˜….  

The idea is very simple. 

In my console i wanted to skin all operations like creating a virtual env for python project, initializing a git repo, adding a readme and .gitignore file.

Check the code [here](https://github.com/JakubSzwajka/new_project_starter)

Choose a file you want (now it is only for windows) and add it to your ```C:/Windows/System32```


**TODO:** 
- make a linux version!
- add some options to exclude some files
