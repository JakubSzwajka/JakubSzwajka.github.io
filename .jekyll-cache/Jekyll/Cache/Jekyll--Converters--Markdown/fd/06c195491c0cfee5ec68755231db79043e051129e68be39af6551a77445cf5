I"Á<p>Last project was definitely a game changer for me. From newbie waiting for specification to a quite aware developer? Maybe. Definitely a game changer.</p>

<p>I want to sum my thoughts up as a little list/checklist/guidebook for me or you. Donâ€™t know if those advices will suit you. Maybe they are project dependent. I was working as a single developer. Starting from backend only and ending as full stack. Consider it, reading this list.</p>
