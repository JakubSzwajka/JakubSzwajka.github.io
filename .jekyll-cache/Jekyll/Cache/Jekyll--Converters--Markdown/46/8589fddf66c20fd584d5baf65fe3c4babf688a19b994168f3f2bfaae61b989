I"å<p>Most of the loading screens I saw, based on boolean variable <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">loading</code>. Then based on it, component <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">loadingScreen</code> is returned or the actual page. The more data I wanted to load, the more <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">if statements</code> I had to make to check if I am still loading. More such ifs sounds like a bad idea to me ğŸ¤·â€â™€ï¸.</p>
