I"È<p>Let the first one cast the stone who didnâ€™t use the print statement to debug and forgot to remove it after! What if I tell you that you can build your â€˜printsâ€™ system while developing? Setting logging in Django is quite simple. Iâ€™ve summed up Django <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/topics/logging/">docs</a> about logging in form of a quick snippet. There are a few logging ideas that help me a lot. Hope you find it useful.</p>
